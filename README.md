# MotoAR
MotoAR was a project created at HackGenY. The goal of the project was to create augmented reality for the 
motorcyle by using Google Glass. The main features include a compass, a speedometer, and turn-by-turn
directions that are sent from a paired Android device. This project is a work in progress, and will be added to 
and made available for download soon.
